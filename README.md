# Regression
This project applies Linear Regression to predict crop yield based on various agricultural factors. It demonstrates how machine learning can be used in agriculture to support decision-making and improve productivity.

📂 Dataset

File: Crop_Yield_Prediction.csv

The dataset contains information on crops and their yields, along with other influencing features.

Preprocessing includes categorical encoding (Crop feature) and feature/target separation.

⚙️ Approach

Load and clean the dataset using Pandas.

Encode categorical features for model training.

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Train a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.

Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

📊 Results

Model performance was evaluated using MSE, providing insights into prediction accuracy.

Visualizations (if added) can be used to compare predicted vs. actual yields.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn
